						This is a sample paragraph. Oh no! I lost my initial text, so I have to

						 <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
							Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
							Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
							when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
							specimen book. 
							<p>
							It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
							electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
							the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
							and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
							including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

						<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
						Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
						It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
						making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
						at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
						Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
						the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable 
						source. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
						 Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
							45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
							 the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

						<p id="debug"><!--Just for debugging-->
						The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
						 below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
						  from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
						   in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from
						    the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
